About this project-
This project is all about moving object detection. This is a simple project in which i have used the video in which a car is moving and by calculating the absolute difference between the images and on the basis of difference i have calculated the roi and based on the roi i have find the moving object in the video.
I have minimized the noise by dilation and by the if condition i have cover up the small moving objects and this algo will only find the bigger moving objects like car,horse,humans etc.
